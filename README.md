##*How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?*
>
**Over the many past several years, the main bank’s customers have been unhappy about the quality, timeliness and cost of the lending services provided by the major and the minor banks in Australia. Their frustration and anger arise out of experiences dealing with the banks for business lending. The main causes for this dissatisfaction are due to:
1.Lengthy application forms and other related verifications.
2.Long delays in getting loan approval and then disbursements.
3.Dealing with different people in the bank for one purpose
4. One arm of the bank not knowing what the other arm does and so this results in customers repeating themselves all over again to different bank employees.
5.Long delays and queues in telephone customer service
6.Branch closures result in more queueing at the operating branches and this causes more frustration
7.Clerical errors at different levels – at the level of broker, bank’s application input team, assessment team and settlement team. These often end up in delayed settlement, thereby causing extreme stress and monetary losses for the customers**
